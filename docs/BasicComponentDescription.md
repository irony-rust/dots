# Introduction

## Basic components description

Dots have several main logic blocks:
* Store Segment
* Brokering Segment
* Carrier Management Segment
* Supporting Segment
* Machine Lerning Segment

### Store Segment

Logical segment that response to integration of 
external stores, internet shops, and any other 
POS (Point of Service) with customers and 
order logics.

### Brokering Segment

Logical segment that response to integration of

Broker take care about optimization and 
system topology efficiecy, delivery events, 
services discovery, traffic and events 
balancing.

### Carrier Management Segment

choosing carriers by optimal criterias, road traffic and
other effectiveness delivery parameters.

### Supporting Segment

of management team, support team, developers 
team, CI and DevOps team, for common tasks 
for supporting.

for order quality diagnistics (for example 
quality of pizza etc.), optimization process 
for all components, optimization for orders 
delivery.
